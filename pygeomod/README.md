pygeomod
========

Python module to read, modify and safe XML files generated with the Geomodeller software (www.geomodeller.com). In addition, the module contains several methods for an easier access of the Geomodeller API through a Python wrapper.

Please note that this functionality is very much in a beta state. It works well on Linux, but requires some more tweaking for Windows.
